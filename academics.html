       	<br>Thank you for exploring training with the Department of Medicine at Cambridge Hospital. Through our Harvard Medical School affiliated programs, we have prepared health professionals for a wide variety of satisfying careers for over three decades.<br><br>
	At Cambridge Hospital, you will find a highly integrated, community-oriented health care system that is a national model of care. We celebrate our ethnically and culturally diverse community and staff. We promote a respectful, socially conscious, and intellectually stimulating environment for health care and education. Our vision statement speaks of our passion and commitment: we seek to be the foremost academic public health care system in the nation. Over the past decade, we have received recognition that speaks to the breadth of our service and academic mission and our "Institute for Community Health" provides a focus for relevant research and education.<br><br>
The Department of Medicine provides comprehensive primary care and specialty services in a model designed to meet the needs of the community. Department services are available at more than 15 primary care sites and three hospital campuses. Patients and staff benefit from the use of clinical computing through a state-of-the-art electronic medical records system. All full-time department members have faculty appointments at Harvard Medical School.<br><br>
The Department is structured in divisions, which include: Cardiology; Endocrinology; Geriatrics; Hematology/Oncology; Hospital Medicine; Neurology; Occupational/ Environmental Medicine; Pulmonary Medicine; Rheumatology; Medical Education; and Social and Community Medicine. Clinical specialties include a Multidisciplinary HIV/AIDS center and Tuberculosis clinic. Primary care medicine is integrated in an Alliance-wide Department of Ambulatory Care.<br><br>
The philosophy of the department - and of the Alliance as a whole - is to create a community of caring that extends to patients, staff, and trainees. Training programs are solid academically and clinically, yet offer a flexible environment that allows residents to excel. Our residents benefit from community-based training in an integrated public health care system with access to tertiary care training opportunities at other Harvard-affiliated institutions. Throughout this system our diverse faculty and house staff are committed to improving the health of the public. This shared dedication, paired with an environment of respectfulness, allows us to pursue true academic and clinical excellence.<br><br>
Thank you again for your interest in the Department of Medicine at Cambridge Hospital. I am confident that you will appreciate the uniqueness of our institution and training programs and the sincerity of our commitment to excellence.<br><br><br><br>

				<h2> Transitional Year Residency</h2>
    
    <br><b><i>The Transitional Year Residency provides an outstanding 1-year training experience at a Harvard teaching hospital right outside of Vambridge Hospital, Blvd.</i></b><br><br>
This experience is designed to give our residents a solid foundation in clinical medicine that will prepare them for any future training program. Residents will have the advantages of training in a community hospital setting, while being part of the larger Harvard Medical School Academic community.<br><br>
Our patient population is the highlight of our training program. Cambridge Hospital serves a very diverse population, and residents enjoy the opportunity to take care of patients from various ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. PGY 1 residents take primary responsibility for their patients while being closely supervised by senior residents and attendings.<br>
Rotations include inpatient medicine, critical care, ambulatory medicine, emergency medicine, surgery, pediatrics, elective, vacation. All residents participate in quality improvement projects. A wide selection of electives gives our trainees the opportunity to tailor their experience to meet individual learning needs.<br><br>
Our Transitional Residency is very closely intertwined with our Internal Medicine Training Program. Medical and transitional residents work together on teams, share schedules, patients, teachers and in fact the whole training experience.<br><br>
The curriculum for each rotation emphasizes the six ACGME competencies: Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, Practice Based Learning and Improvement, Professionalism, Interpersonal and Communication Skills and Systems Based Practice. Our program emphasizes frequent feedback and evaluation so that residents are ensured to have a solid training experience.<br><br>
Faculty are dedicated to housestaff training and professional development. The small size of the program offers the advantage of individualized teaching and mentoring. The training experience is enhanced by small group teaching, problem based learning, bedside teaching and didactic lectures. Extensive hospital-based and on-line resources are available for self-directed learning.<br><br>
Our program attracts highly dedicated candidates with excellent academic records and diverse interests. Housestaff have a strong collegial spirit, and lifelong friendships often develop during this intense training experience. Graduating Transitional Year residents leave with a wonderful sense of accomplishment, personal and professional growth, and remain connected to us in spirit as they move on to pursue their further careers. <br><br><br><br>

			<h2> Podiatric Surgery Residency </h2>
            
     <br><b><i>The Cambridge Health Alliance Podiatric Medicine and Surgery Residency is a three-year program (PMSR/RRA) approved by the Council on Podiatric Medical Education.</i></b><br><br>
Cambridge Hospital (CBH) is accredited by the Joint Commission and is comprised of three hospital campuses, Cambridge Health Alliance, Somerville Hospital, and Whidden Hospital. We are a Harvard Medical School teaching affiliate and there is excellent interdisciplinary cooperation and collegiality amongst the training programs at the institution.<br><br>
The podiatric medicine and surgery residency is authorized for a total of six residents, two in each year of training. The residency is designed in a rotational structure with an emphasis on resource based, competency driven, and assessment validated training. <br><br>
The resident is provided with a greater responsibility in patient care and decision making as they progress through their training. These experiences coincide with a complimentary curriculum of didactic activities such as journal club, skills workshops, case review and lectures. The residents and attendings have teaching responsibilities to students, medical staff / house officers and the surrounding communities. Research opportunities are readily available and a requirement for program completion.<br><br>
Due to a combination of community-based and regional referral patient mix, the medical and surgical volume and diversity is exceptional. The residents are fully integrated into two active outpatient podiatric clinics which allow for involvement throughout a patients' medical or surgical management. The residents also scrub and assist in surgery at local hospitals that are not part of the CBH system.<br><br>
Clinical affiliations with all of the podiatric medical schools allow third and fourth year podiatric medical students to rotate through CBH on a monthly basis to augment their clinical curriculum. Students are actively involved in the clinic, operating room, emergency department and all didactic activities.
