    <h2> Quality and Safety Program</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <br><b><i>The Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine at Cambridge Hospital is committed to providing the highest quality and safest care to our patients.</i></b><br><br>
<br>The mission of the Quality and Safety Program in the Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine is to deliver the highest quality and safest care to our patients. Under the leadership of our Quality and Safety (Q&S) team and several Q&S committees, there are many initiatives underway in the department to support this mission. All of our committees are multidisciplinary and include representation from faculty, nurse anesthetists, residents, critical care nurses and administrators.
<br><br>
<h3>Quality Assurance Committee</h3>
<br><br>
The Quality Assurance (QA) Committee is responsible for the review, follow-up and educational debrief of patient safety events and situations with the potential to cause harm. We take a systems approach and with each case seek to determine how we can improve our processes to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. The QA Committee also provides a Peer Support Program that focuses on the well-being of clinicians involved in serious events.
<br><br>
<h3>Quality and Safety Improvement Committee</h3>
<br><br>
The QA Committee works closely with the Quality and Safety Improvement Committee (QSIC), a process improvement group responsible for the implementation of recommendations from the QA Committee and suggestions shared by department clinicians. An editorial published in the February 2014 issue of Anesthesiology explains our philosophy on the integration of quality assurance and quality improvement activities. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24317206"> Read the article (PubMed login required)</a>
<br>
Some of the QSIC’s improvement efforts have included:
<br>
Implementation of more thorough pre- and post-operative evaluations
<br>Standardization of operating room anesthesia tray set up and turnover between cases<Br>
Implementation of a standardized pre-procedure “time-out” prior to invasive procedures performed by the anesthesia care team<br>
Most recently, we are pursuing the introduction of emergency manuals across all anesthetizing locations and the development of a patient satisfaction survey.
<br><br>
Leading in discovery, innovation and education<br>
Recruiting, retaining and developing the highest quality team members<br>
Using ongoing assessment and analysis to improve performance in each of our domains
<br><br>
Our vision is to be the premier academic anesthesia department delivering the best patient care. The DACCPM works to build open, respectful and constructive communication among members of the department, patients and others within the Mass General community. Our department believes in:<br><br>
Building trust and teamwork through collaboration<br>
Providing expert, compassionate and professional patient care<br>
Ensuring quality, safety and efficiency in everything we do<br>
Helping each other grow and develop professionally<br>
A commitment to doing our best every day
